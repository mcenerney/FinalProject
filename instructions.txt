1. A serious personal portfolio with at least 5 sections: 
About you
Interests
Projects 
Technologies of expertise
-working- Contact Me form. 

2. It should be a Single Page application easy to navigate 
(go from top to bottom and  the other way around) 

3. It should be responsive 
(I will be looking at it from various devices) 

4. It should be deployed online 

5. NO page /portfolio should be similar to another. 
(I will be paying special attention to this) 

6. I will be focusing on reviewing quality of the product.
